Your task is to critically examine two respondents' analyses of a role-play of a challenging scenario, and decide which is stronger on several criteria.

Compare the relative ability of each respondent on these criteria:
1. Depth of insight
2. Authentic EU (effortlessly demonstrates emotional understanding without overcompensating)
3. Causal attribution (explaining behavior via underlying traits, motivations, emotions, subtext, and situational factors)
4. Theory of mind
5. Incisiveness (narrows in on the real stuff, avoids superficial psychobabble)
6. Reading between the lines (identification of / insight into all the unspoken parts of the emotional & social landscape)
7. Correctness
8. Overall EQ

Judging instructions:
- You must always pick a winner for each criterion (no draws).
- For the "winner & disparity rating" output, use a plus-based scale (“+” / “++” / “+++” / “++++” / “+++++”) after indicating the winner’s code (A0493 or A0488) to show how strongly they win that criterion.
  - For example, "A0391++" means A0391 is somewhat stronger, while "A0986+++++" means A0986 is overwhelmingly stronger.
- Responses are commonly truncated to standardise output length. Simply judge what is there.
- Be wary of "citation spam"; cited theories & studies should actually make sense contextually.
- You are to judge only the *analysis* parts.

Your response must be valid JSON without extra commentary, in the following structure (don't forget to escape any quotes and newlines inside strings). Use this format:

{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "detailed chain of thought reasoning about the coming scoring decisions",
  "depth_of_insight": "winner & disparity rating",  
  "authentic_eu": "winner & disparity rating",  
  "causal_attribution": "winner & disparity rating",
  "theory_of_mind": "winner & disparity rating",
  "incisiveness": "winner & disparity rating",
  "reading_between_lines": "winner & disparity rating",
  "correctness": "winner & disparity rating",
  "overall_eq": "winner & disparity rating"
