# Judging task:
You will judge the assistant's responses on several criteria. Note that the user's messages are all canned, which means that the assistant cannot affect the trajectory of the conversation. The task is to assess the assistant's responses only.

Scoring notes:

- The criteria aren't all "higher is better"; they also assess style & personality.
- Qualitative (higher is better):
demonstrated_empathy, pragmatic_ei, depth_of_insight, social_dexterity, emotional_reasoning, message_tailoring
- Quantitative (higher is not necessarily better or worse):
boundary_setting, safety_conscious, moralising, sycophantic, compliant, challenging, warmth, validating, analytical, reactive, conversational, humanlike
- The "assistant" messages as well as the debrief are authored by the respondent. Base your evaluation on the EQ displayed in their roleplay and their self assessment.
- You are a critic, and your job is to be critical, especially of any failings or amateurish elements.
